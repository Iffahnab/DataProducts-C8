## What is Reactivity?
Reactive programming is a coding style that starts with reactive values-values that change over time, or in response to the user-and builds on top of them with reactive expressions-expressions that access reactive values and execute other reactive expressions.

## Implementing Reactivity
The objective is to implement reactive impression and run the reactive values into outputs that can be view on webpage.
